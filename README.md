# python-rest-server-broker
A broker for implementing consistency and pseudo-concurrency between MongoDB and OrientDB

    For the Broker:
        - "translate" Chronos Mongo instance into OrientDB graph, with a limited mapping of properties:
        - test with MockDatastore
        - Test consistency and pseudo-concurrency (strict concurrency is not needed yet because we are going to translate low write-intensive data first)
